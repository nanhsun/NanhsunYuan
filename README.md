# Projects in Texas Instruments Internship
This folder contains the following three projects I did during my time in Texas Instruments.
## TrimForm Tool Monitor 
This project includes Python scripts that help monitor the life cycle of tools in trimming/forming machines. The code presents a UI using PySimpleGUI to allow users to easily see which tool is reaching its end-of-life.
## N2 Saving Alarm 
This project includes Python scripts that keep track of solder reflow oven's waste of nitrogen gas and send alert emails to engineers.
## XRay Data Consolidation 
This project includes Python scripts that extract data from SharePoint and exports an easy-to-read Excel file for engineers to know which task hasn't been done yet.
